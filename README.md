This application makes use of the MERN stack to accomplish this. React is used with Functional and Stateful components to deliver a seamless experience. Axios is used to hit the API routes for CRUD operations and the scrape method (which is on the backend). React Router Dom handles the URL routing for React. the Request package is used for the scraper to grab JSON from the NY Times API. This App also makes use of environment variables by setting the api key in a .env file._
